  Or that's why I would like to say, but I'm just a curious nobody in cyber security into:
  
  - 🔭 Forensics
  - :loop: OSINT
  - :tophat: Hacking

<p id=to_follow_me>
  I like to learn and explore new things, so you are going to see a lot of contents updating in my github as times goes on, so don't forget to follow me. 
  I'm going to publish the courses I follow, certifications I'm craming on as well as the CTFs and challenges I'm working on with my personal notes and referencement advices. 

  If you want to have more insiders informations and more details about my experience, or just want to learn more about my cyber journey, I invite you to go to take a look at my Blog. <br>
  Well actually, truth to be said, I haven't created it yet so the link won't work for now. But I'm working on it and make it available as quickly as possible. I promise you. <br> <br>
  The Blog is going to retrace my Cyber Journey (like a personal journal) containing:

  - Courses & Certifications followed with my personal experiences, my feeling, what I learned, my tips & avdice and who I would recommend it 
  - Challenges & CTFs with personal experiences, tips & advice

  <br>
  You can also follow me on my LinkedIn, where I will post regulary about My Cyber Journey.
